title: Migration from Goodtables
---

In [Goodtables](https://goodtables.io) you did need to create a `goodtables.yml` file in your repository, otherwise 
it would validates all your files with extensions as CSV, ODS, XLS or XLSX as described
[here](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/goodtables.io/blob/master/docs/configuration/index.md).

Instead of the `goodtables.yml` file, you will need to create a github workflow file `.github/frictionless.yaml` as describe
[here](/docs/getting-started).
