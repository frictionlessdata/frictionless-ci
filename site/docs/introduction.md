Frictionless Repository is a Github Action created for continuous data validation. It is a minimalistic integration between [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/). In this introduction we will show an example of its work and describe the projects it relies on.

## How It Works

On every commit to your repository there will be run a validation process to find tabular errors and other problems in your data. A visual validation report will be provided:

## Github Actions

Github Actions is a continuous integration service. If you're not familiar with Github Actions we really recommend you to watch a short talk given by [Grant R. Vousden-Dishington](https://github.com/GrantRVD) on csv,conf,v6:

## Frictionless Data

Frictionless Data is a comprehensive data software and standards project covering many aspects working with data. Frictionless Repository uses a Python framework to validate data and a report component to show the validation results:
- [Frictionless Framework](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/)
- [Frictionless Components](https://components.frictionlessdata.io/?path=/story/components-report--invalid)

Frictionless Repository can be described by this simple flow:
- you add a Frictionless Repository step to their workflow on Github
- Frictionless Framework validates your data and saves the result as a workflow's artifact
- Frictionless Components fetch and render this validation report

Frictionless Repository is completely server-less so it doesn't rely on any third-party hardware except for Github infrastructure. There is no vendor-lock or something like this a you can fork this project and run it on Github differently if needed.
